![latest tag](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeU5.svg?color=brightgreen)

**STM32Cube** is an STMicroelectronics original initiative to ease the developers life by reducing efforts, time and cost.

**STM32Cube** covers the overall STM32 products portfolio. It includes a comprehensive embedded software platform (this repo), delivered for each series (such as the STM32CubeU5 for the STM32U5 series).
   * The CMSIS modules (core and device) corresponding to the ARM-tm core implemented in this STM32 product
   * The STM32 HAL-LL drivers : an abstraction drivers layer, the API ensuring maximized portability across the STM32 portfolio
   * The BSP Drivers of each evaluation or demonstration board provided by this STM32 series 
   * A consistent set of middleware libraries such as ThreadX, FileX, USBX, NetDuoX, OpenBootloader, USBPD, trustedfirmware, mbed-crypto, mbedTLS, Network Library ...
   * A template project projects
   * A full set of software projects (basic examples, applications and/or demonstrations) for each board provided by this STM32 series
   * A new LPBAM utility which is a software helper that assists STM32U5 Users in the elaboration of LPBAM scenarios
   * A development with three Toolchains and Compilers (IAR Embedded Workbench for ARM (EWARM), RealView Microcontroller Development Kit (MDK-ARM) and STM32CubeIDE )

The **STM32CubeU5 MCU Package** projects are directly running on the STM32U5 series boards. You can find in each Projects/*Board name* directories a set of software projects (Applications, Demonstration, Examples).
